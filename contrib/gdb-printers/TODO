Non-comprehensive list of pending issues:

Components listed with no further details indicate that support for that
component is completely missing from the pretty printer.  Support is *not*
really complete.  The pretty printer does not support non-polymorphic
allocators.

Issues are not listed in any particular order.

Improvements                Concerns
--------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------
Usability                   Allow printing of the bslma::Allocator in the first
                            (outer component) but skip it internally.

                            Add 'terse' printing that will also skip capacity()
                            (size()?)

General                     Concerns
--------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------
Iterator support            Should we print the contents? How do we know if the
                            iterator is dereferencable?

Usability                   Provide functions that will inspect a concrete
                            value, like:
                            (gdb) bslprint myvector 5
                            <print the 5th element in the container>
