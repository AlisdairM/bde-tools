# Usage: ./makedoc.sh <path-to-bde-repository>
#
# This script will create doxygen documentation for BDE Release 3.0.0, based on
# the header and package documentation files found in a copy of the BDE
# repository stored at the specified 'path-to-bde-repository'.  The
# repository must have the 'BDE_3.0.0.0' tag checked out.
#
# This script must be run from the 'samples' directory where it is stored, and
# the resulting documentation will be created in a subdirectory named 'output',
# which will be created if necessary.
#
# Note that the Doxygen 1.7.1 executable must be in one of the directories in
# your 'PATH'.
