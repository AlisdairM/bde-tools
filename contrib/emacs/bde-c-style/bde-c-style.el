;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a cc-mode C/C++ style, 'bde', that conforms to the BDE
;; style guide.
;;
;; To use, make sure that this file is in your load path, and set "bde" as the
;; default c++-mode style:
;;
;;     (require 'bde-c-style)
;;     (add-to-list 'c-default-style '(c++-mode . "bde"))
;;     (add-to-list 'c-default-style '(c-mode . "bde"))
;;
;; Alternatively, you can call `c-set-style' in the `c-mode-common-hook':
;;
;;     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;;          (lambda () (c-set-style "bde"))
;;
;; To find out more about how to customize CC-mode indentation, take a look at
;; the cc-mode manual:
;;
;;   http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/html-manual/Indentation-Engine-Basics.html

- The default indentation is is '+' (1 basic offset).
- Unless:
  - This is a case statement in a switch.  The indentation of this statement
    will be set to '*' (half basic offset).
  - This is a nested for-loop declaration, whose parent for-loop is immediately
    above this line.  The indentation of this statement will be set to 0.

Examples:
..
